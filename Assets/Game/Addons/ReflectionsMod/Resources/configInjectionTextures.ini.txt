; example for texture-global reflectivity and smoothness:
;
;		[337_3 {Mages Guild Ground Texture (Woodland)}] 
;		textureArchive = 337
;		textureRecord = 3
;		textureFrame = 0
;		useMetallicGlossMap = false
;		reflectivity = 0.6
;		smoothness = 0.65
;
;
; example for reflectivity and smoothness from metallic gloss map:
; (metallic (reflectivity) is sampled from r-channel of texture, gloss (smoothness) is sampled from alpha channel of texture)
; filename of metallic gloss map has to be without file extension (e.g. don't put .png in there) and the file needs to be in the Resources folder
;
;		[444_3 {House Ground Texture (Swamp)}]
;		textureArchive = 444
;		textureRecord = 3
;		textureFrame = 0
;		useMetallicGlossMap = true
;		filenameMetallicGlossMap = metallicGlossMap_Texture_444_3
;
; you can inject albedo and normal maps also - ONLY WORKING FOR FLOOR TEXTURES CORRECTLY!!! - (e.g. for texture files in Resources folder and filenames custom_texture.png and custom_texture_normals.png):
;		filenameAlbedoMap = custom_texture
;		filenameNormalMap = custom_texture_normals
