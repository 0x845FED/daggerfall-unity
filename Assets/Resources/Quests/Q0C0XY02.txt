<ce>                     Thou wouldst help ==qgiver_,
<ce>                     %pcf? Many come to us for aid,
<ce>                    and then turn from us once their
<ce>                   wishes have been met, their oaths
<ce>                     are curses, their promises are
<ce>                    abominations. For the gratitude
<ce>                         of ==qgiver_, wouldst
<ce>                      thou punish one transgressor
<ce>                          for the sisterhood?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Not even that wouldst thou do?
<ce>                         %oth, by ==daedra_, I
<ce>                  suppose it is better not to promise
<ce>                  what thou cannot deliver, yet still
<ce>                            I am aggrieved.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Wilt thou truly? If thou wilt, a fine
<ce>                        _mitem_ will be crafted
<ce>                for thee. Now, journey thou to farthest
<ce>                     __tavern_ and seek he who has
<ce>                    betrayed us, a villianous =man_
<ce>                        who calls himself _man_.
<ce>                Give to him this _jewelry_, tell him it
<ce>                 is a gift from his old lover, and then
<ce>                  come back to us. Thou must to hurry,
<ce>                  for the _jewelry_ will transform his
<ce>                 outerself to a semblance of his inner
<ce>                         beauty. ==qgiver_ wilt
<ce>                   expect thee in =queston_ days. May
<ce>                         ==daedra_ smile on thy
<ce>                             sacred quest.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       Good %pcf, thy promise to
<ce>                      the ==qgiver_ is fulfilled.
<ce>                         Here is the _mitem_ I
<ce>                         promised. Poor _man_.
<ce>                I hope they allow him to suffer deeply,
<ce>                       before he is put to death.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_man_ is a true example of self-made man. A marvel to behold.
<--->
==qgiver_ can be extremely vengeful.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_man_ is laughing at the idea that %g owes anything to ==qgiver_.
<--->
_man_ has left __tavern_. And %g will be sorely missed.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_man_ transformed into a horrible beast before the tavernfolk at _tavern_.
<--->
_man_ must have been trafficking with daedra. %oth, what a fate.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Truly, I hope thou art enjoying thy _mitem_, %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      Our vengeance against _man_
<ce>                  is not complete! Get thee from here,
<ce>                  or %g3 deserved fate wilt be visited
<ce>                            upon thou, %pcf.

Message:  1011
<ce>                         _man_ thanks you for
<ce>                    the _jewelry_. He tries it on as
<ce>                  you are telling him who sent it. His
<ce>                   eyes light up in fear at the name
<ce>                       of ==qgiver_, and then the
<ce>                          fear turns to pain.

Message:  1012
<ce>                    Thou wert not to kill the man,
<ce>                   merely give to him the _jewelry_!
<ce>                          Oaf! Assassin! _man_
<ce>                was to suffer deeply for his insolence,
<ce>                        not be painlessly slain.
<ce>                            ==daedra_ curse
<ce>                              thee, %pcf.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 ==qgiver_ of
 %reg has sent me to bring a
 _jewelry_ to a man by the name of
 _man_ in __tavern_.
 I was told to move hastily for the
 _jewelry_ would "transform his
 outerself to a semblance of his
 inner beauty." I must have the
 _jewelry_ in his hands and
 get back with ==qgiver_ in
 no more than =queston_ days.
