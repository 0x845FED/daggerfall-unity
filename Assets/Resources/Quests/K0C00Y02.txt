<ce>                 %pcf, I may be in very great trouble
<ce>             indeed. It would appear that one of my former
<ce>             associates, in an effort to make my life more
<ce>               hellish, has passed some counterfeit gold
<ce>               bricks to me. Innocently I passed them on
<ce>               to four of my most valued allies in return
<ce>                for services rendered. I obviously must
<ce>               retrieve those bricks before they discover
<ce>                that the gold is foscarium, which may be
<ce>                in =2mondung_ days or less. I am paying
<ce>            _reward_ gold pieces for each bar of false gold
<ce>                that you can retrieve. Sound agreeable?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               No? Really? Very well. Someone else will
<ce>                be more agreeable, I'm certain of that.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                %oth, that's good. Now, one of the bars
<ce>                  is in a bank called _depository_ in
<ce>                 __depository_; one is in a stronghold
<ce>                          called ___mondung_;
<ce>                   one is in __palace_ at the palace
<ce>                         there; the last is in
<ce>                        _mansion_ in __mansion_.
<ce>             Now, recall that you only have =2mondung_ days
<ce>               for this, and I'd rather have one in that
<ce>                  time than all four. Good luck, %pcf.
<ce>                        %god bless your journey.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     %god, would you please hurry?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       %oth, well done, %pcf. I
<ce>                  was afraid I hadn't given you enough
<ce>                time. Here's your real gold in exchange
<ce>                          for that false gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Some chap just asked directions to _depository_. He didn't look like a banker.
<--->
<ce>             They're apparently recruiting at ___mondung_.
 At least, it's pretty active there.
                                     <--->
_palace_ is improving its security, due to rumors about thieves in the area.
<--->
The maid at _mansion_ said she saw some undesirables watching the place.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
%t %rn is seems to think that the head of the smuggling operation is _qgiver_.
<--->
_qgiver_ has apparently been smuggling foscarium, pretending its gold.
<--->
_palace_ has cut off relations with _qgiver_ completely, from what I hear.
<--->
___mondung_ is working toward breaking up every aspect of _qgiver_'s business.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_qgiver_ has kindly replaced all the gold %g3 clumsy allies lost to theft.
<--->
_qgiver_'s popularity with the top business leaders in %reg continues to rise.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Hail and hello, you bearer of false gold.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I trusted you with my financial future once, remember, %pcf?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_ has
 asked me to retrieve at least one of
 the four bars of false gold %g gave
 to %g3 allies before they discover the
 truth about the gold -- in =2mondung_ days
 or less. One bar of gold is in each
 of the following places:
 _palace_ in __palace_,
 ___mondung_,
 _mansion_ in __mansion_,
 and _depository_ in __depository_.
 I will be given _reward_ gold pieces
 for each bar of gold I can get for him.
