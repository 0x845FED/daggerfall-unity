      powers. Soon you were able to %q1a[/left]\n yourself. You remember your father
      talking about an evil[/left]\n Battlemage, Jagar Tharn, how it was known in
      his circle[/left]\n that he had usurped the power of the land away from its[/left]\n
      rightful ruler. No one dared to move against him.[/left]\n %q2.[/left]\n One
      day in your twentieth year, a courier arrived at your[/left]\n house with the
      news that a powerful hero had killed[/left]\n Jagar Tharn and restored the
      rightful Emperor to the throne.[/left]\n Your tender-hearted father openly
      wept with joy at the news.[/left]\n [/left]\n The courier also brought the
      news that there would be a great[/left]\n celebration in Imperial City and
      that all the people who had[/left]\n worked secretly to depose Tharn were invited.
      Once the[/left]\n courier left, you asked your father if you could go to the[/left]\n
      celebration. Your father turned to you and said[/left]\n that it was time you
      made your own way in the world. He gave[/left]\n you %q4 and a very unusual
      staff[/left]\n and sent you on your way to the Imperial City and the[/left]\n
      celebration.[/left]\n [/left]\n After many days of travel, you approached the
      capital of the[/left]\n realm, the Imperial City. You noticed a small band
      of[/left]\n travelers only a short distance in front of you. As you were[/left]\n
      about to hail them they were attacked by brigands who had[/left]\n been lying
      in wait in the woods along the road. You rushed[/left]\n to help the other
      travelers. As you approached one of the[/left]\n brigands raised his short
      sword to strike you. In a natural[/left]\n reflex, you tried to deflect the
      blow with the staff your[/left]\n father gave you. As the sword struck the
      staff, a great bolt[/left]\n of lightning erupted from it and both weapons
      shattered. The[/left]\n brigands and the travelers all stopped and stared at
      you.[/left]\n As the thunder subsided, the brigands ran back into the[/left]\n
      woods. You were mobbed by the travelers who thanked you[/left]\n profusely
      for saving them, members of the Imperial Family[/left]\n who had been visiting
      in the country and were returning to[/left]\n the Imperial City for the celebrations.
      They insisted that[/left]\n you come with them to the palace and have an audience
      with[/left]\n the Emperor.[/left]\n [/left]\n The Emperor was very impressed
      by your bravery and knew[/left]\n your family as loyal supporters of the Empire.
      He presented[/left]\n you with %q5. The celebrations continued for weeks,[/left]\n
      and the Emperor often called on you for informal talks.[/left]\n When you were
      not in audience, you usually spent your time[/left]\n %q2a.[/left]\n One night
      you were called to the Emperor's presence in a[/left]\n manner such that you
      knew the business was serious. He[/left]\n met you in his study and there told

      approached the[/left]\n heads of the local Thieves and Mages Guild. He had
      told[/left]\n them that the Emperor had heard rumors of a[/left]\n %q8 named

      Jagar Tharn.[/left]\n The Emperor dared not act against %bn[/left]\n without
      proper evidence to verify his illegal actions.[/left]\n Your father suggested
      that, as a pair, you two were just[/left]\n right for the assignment. Excited
      about the chance[/left]\n to impress your father as much as the Emperor's reward,[/left]\n
      you agreed at once.[/left]\n [/left]\n Some nights later, you and your father
      broke into[/left]\n %bn's study and began searching for[/left]\n evidence of
      conspiracy. A noise out in the hall[/left]\n nearly caused you to drop the
      stack of papers you were[/left]\n carrying. Quickly, as agreed before, you
      moved off to the[/left]\n exit route carrying %bn's materials[/left]\n while
      your father headed off to provide a distraction. He[/left]\n gave you a wink

      to your home.[/left]\n [/left]\n There, a portly mage and an Imperial courier
      examined the[/left]\n materials, and from their reactions, the evidence damned[/left]\n
      %bn. You sat with your mother and[/left]\n fretfully awaited your father's
      return. The hours turned[/left]\n to days, and you numbly realized that you
      would never see[/left]\n your father again. The receipt of the Emperor's reward[/left]\n
      seemed small consolation for your loss.[/left]\n [/left]\n Some weeks later,

      you were proud whenever you were able to help.[/left]\n [/left]\n It was just
      such an outlaw band that caused the combat wound[/left]\n that was ultimately
      fatal to your grandfather. You and he were[/left]\n able to return to his home,
      and at first he tried to act as if[/left]\n this were just another scratch,
      to be allowed to naturally[/left]\n heal. But finally even he faced the inevitability
      of his age[/left]\n and accumulated injuries, and he gave you careful instructions[/left]\n
      concerning the disposition of his possessions. He also told[/left]\n you to
      go to a temple being run by an old friend of his, to[/left]\n continue your
      growth and sustain your %q1 training[/left]\n and allow you to continue %q3a.[/left]\n
      A few days later, your grandfather died with the quiet dignity[/left]\n that
      he had always displayed. You were distraught at the loss[/left]\n of the only
      friend and family that you had ever had, but you[/left]\n packed your few belongings
      and travelled to the temple,[/left]\n honoring your grandfather's request.[/left]\n
      [/left]\n %fn, the chief priestess of the temple[/left]\n was an older woman,
      but she was much younger than your[/left]\n grandfather had been. You shared
      your sorrow with her for[/left]\n your recent loss. Then you agreed with her
      that, besides[/left]\n general training in %q1 and similar[/left]\n studies,
      you would ignore the set of courses dealing with[/left]\n armor and shields.
      To pay for your training, you used your[/left]\n forestry skills to provide
      a regular supply of fresh meat[/left]\n for the temple's larder.[/left]\n [/left]\n
      Some years later, on a day that seemed like any other, you had[/left]\n just
      returned from collecting game for the food supply when the[/left]\n chief priestess
      came to see you. She told you that she received[/left]\n a message that an
      Imperial coach was ambushed at a location[/left]\n close to the temple, and
      that important people and material[/left]\n needed to be recovered. You allowed
      yourself an hour to perform[/left]\n your grandfather's favorite meditation
      exercises, and left on[/left]\n this new mission both refreshed and with some
      insight[/left]\n concerning where to search for the robbers. Your meditations[/left]\n
      bore fruit at dusk, as you stealthily approached an encampment[/left]\n approximately
      where you had expected it to be. Throughout[/left]\n the night you gradually
      stalked and subdued the camp guard, but[/left]\n then you had to kill all of
      the other outlaws because they[/left]\n resisted capture. You were abashed
      to return to the temple[/left]\n shortly after breakfast with only one captive,
      a maidservant,[/left]\n and a mundane chest of government documents.[/left]\n
      [/left]\n However, when the Imperial representative arrived to claim[/left]\n
      your results, she sought you out to congratulate you on a most[/left]\n successful
      mission. Although you never knew for certain whether[/left]\n the maidservant
      or some of the documents somehow had importance,[/left]\n you were not surprised
      when you later received a most[/left]\n interesting letter from the Imperial
      Palace, simply inviting[/left]\n you to the palace on urgent business. You
      left the temple[/left]\n immediately for the Imperial City.[/left]\n[/record]"

      through her tales and[/left]\n legends about them. She even knew some words
      of their[/left]\n language which she taught to you. You vowed to find one,[/left]\n

      the ways of the %hpw and its[/left]\n many inhabitants. Later, your merchant
      father took you to[/left]\n his offices and familiarized you with his work,
      but no[/left]\n interest in this ever really developed. You did benefit[/left]\n
      from the stable home that your parents provided, and your[/left]\n father lovingly
      provided the gold pieces that were[/left]\n required to broaden your %q1[/left]\n

      that led you to a[/left]\n different set of unknown prints that began and ended
      as the[/left]\n previous set had. The next morning you reviewed your mental[/left]\n
      picture of the patterns of tracks, and quartered in towards[/left]\n their
      apparent source.[/left]\n [/left]\n Suddenly a nightmare of hair, teeth and
      claws leapt out[/left]\n of the bushes about ten feet in front of you. You
      scrambled[/left]\n up a tree, and heard the wild man right behind you, grunting[/left]\n
      with glee. As you climbed higher, you heard a branch break[/left]\n under you
      and turned to see the man land hard on the ground.[/left]\n Recognizing the
      opportunity, you leapt down beside him and[/left]\n %q1b.[/left]\n [/left]\n
      You investigated the bushes where he had come from, and[/left]\n discovered
      a cave where the cannibal had kept the bones of[/left]\n several less fortunate
      rangers. You also found a ragged young[/left]\n boy in chains, evidently the
      meal you interrupted. After[/left]\n you freed him, he told you his name was
      %imp,[/left]\n and he was a son of the Emperor Uriel Septim. Something[/left]\n
      about him made you believe him, even when he told you that[/left]\n his father's

      was moving to the outskirts of the civilized area of[/left]\n %hpn to start
      a new village in the %hpw.[/left]\n Your childhood was spent helping to do
      the mundane and[/left]\n grueling work required by this sort of venture. The[/left]\n
      physical hardiness inherited from your parents helped[/left]\n considerably
      in this regard, and you developed physically[/left]\n at an early age. You

      mute boy who kept[/left]\n the bar stocked. He seemed so frightened and alone
      that[/left]\n he reminded you of your own lonely childhood. When one[/left]\n
      of the drunken regulars stuck the boy, you leapt to his[/left]\n defense. The

      your first tutor in the[/left]\n Imperial City. When she disappeared, you were
      the first[/left]\n person to notice and begin an investigation. You must[/left]\n

      and thrown into a cell deep within the[/left]\n sewers, with no food or water.
      It was there that Ria[/left]\n Silmane found you.[/left]\n [/left]\n Ria appeared
      to you as a spectre, for she too had been[/left]\n betrayed by the man who

      used his own lifeforce to empower[/left]\n the Staff.[/left]\n [/left]\n When

      great[/left]\n relevance, you were well rewarded. Still, you were not[/left]\n
      often at court. The Emperor almost considered you a rare[/left]\n and valued
      weapon, to be drawn only away from others'[/left]\n eyes.[/left]\n [/left]\n

      task of his choosing in the future?[/left]\n {8.   Your mother asks you to
      help fix the stove. While[/left]\n     you are working, a very hot pipe slips
      its moorings[/left]\n     and falls towards her. Do you:[/left]\n a) Push your
      mother out of the way?[/left]\n b) Grab the hot pipe and try and push it away?[/left]\n
      c) Position yourself between the pipe and your mother?[/left]\n {9.   While
      in town the baker gives you a sweetroll.[/left]\n    Delighted, you take it
      into an alley to enjoy, only to[/left]\n    be intercepted by a gang of three
      other kids your age.[/left]\n    The leader demands the sweetroll, or else
      he and his[/left]\n    friends will beat you and take it. Do you:[/left]\n
      a) Drop the sweetroll and step on it, then get ready for[/left]\n    the fight?[/left]\n
      b) Give him the sweetroll now without argument, knowing[/left]\n    that later
      this afternoon you will have all your[/left]\n    friends with you and can
      come and take whatever he[/left]\n    owes you?[/left]\n c) Act like you're
      going to give him the sweetroll but[/left]\n    at the last minute throw it
      in the air, hoping that[/left]\n    they'll pay attention to it long enough
      for you to get[/left]\n    a shot in on the leader?[/left]\n {10.    Entering
      town you find that you are witness to a[/left]\n     very well dressed man
      running from a crowd. He screams[/left]\n     to you for help. The crowd behind
      him seems very[/left]\n     angry. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Rush to the man's aid
      immediately, despite your lack[/left]\n     of knowledge of the circumstances?[/left]\n
      b)  Rush to the town's aid immediately, despite your lack[/left]\n     of knowledge
      of the circumstances?[/left]\n c)  Stand aside and allow the man and mob to
      pass,[/left]\n     realizing that it is probably best not to get involved?[/left]\n
      {11.    You and your best friend buy your first daggers[/left]\n     together,
      a matched pair. You loan him the amount[/left]\n     since he doesn't have
      enough gold, and he agrees to[/left]\n     pay you back later. After leaving
      the shop you and he[/left]\n     sit down to marvel at your new weapons. To
      your dismay[/left]\n     you notice that there is a small notch on the blade[/left]\n    
      of the dagger you selected. Your friend asks you to[/left]\n     please watch
      his weapon for him while he runs an[/left]\n     errand. Do you:[/left]\n a) 
      Wait for your friend's return then point out the flaw[/left]\n     in your
      dagger and return to the weapons shop to[/left]\n     demand a refund.[/left]\n
      b)  Switch the daggers, rationalizing that since you paid[/left]\n     for
      them you should get the first choice, and that if[/left]\n     your friend
      ever notices the notch, you could always[/left]\n     take him back to the
      weapon shop and get a refund?[/left]\n c)  Keep his dagger safe until his return,
      then switch the[/left]\n     daggers with your best friend's knowledge, justifying[/left]\n    
      it with the fact that you paid for them, and then[/left]\n     offer to accompany
      him back to the weapons shop?[/left]\n {12.    You are at weapons practice.
      Your Armsmaster is[/left]\n     very old now, but takes his teaching very seriously.[/left]\n    
      You have heard him say it is all he has left in life.[/left]\n     Today he
      has ceaselessly taunted you at every mistake.[/left]\n     Finally he asks
      you to attack him with the same[/left]\n     technique you just did, in an
      effort to show you the[/left]\n     proper execution. Do you:[/left]\n a) 
      Do the technique just fast enough so that he can block[/left]\n     it, knowing
      that it is more important to allow the[/left]\n     master to retain dignity,
      regardless of your personal[/left]\n     feelings?[/left]\n b)  Attack him
      at full speed, knowing that you could[/left]\n     probably score the hit and
      justify his unfair[/left]\n     treatment of you by showing the class that
      you were[/left]\n     actually doing it right?[/left]\n c)  Refuse and leave
      practice, unable to compromise your[/left]\n     anger with his dignity, and
      realizing that whatever[/left]\n     course you choose would cause you to lose
      respect for[/left]\n     either him or for yourself?[/left]\n {13.    While
      throwing a ball to you your friend breaks a[/left]\n     window on his house.
      His father rushes out and demands[/left]\n     to know who broke the window.
      You know that your[/left]\n     friend's father is a strict disciplinarian
      and will[/left]\n     punish your friend severely if he takes the blame. You[/left]\n    
      on the other hand, not being his son, could get away[/left]\n     virtually
      unscathed. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Raise your hand and take the blame before your
      friend[/left]\n     can answer?[/left]\n b)  Remain silent and not get involved?[/left]\n
      c)  Point at your friend, knowing that anything else would[/left]\n     probably
      delay the inevitable and make things just[/left]\n     that much worse for
      him?[/left]\n {14.    Your Armsmaster during a lesson on strategy[/left]\n    
      remarks, 'The best victory is to completely and[/left]\n     totally humiliate
      your opponent'. He then turns to you[/left]\n     and asks you if you agree
      with him. You know the[/left]\n     Armsmaster has been in numerous life and
      death[/left]\n     conflicts and has the experience of a seasoned[/left]\n    
      warrior. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Agree with his remark, knowing that at this moment[/left]\n    
      your experience is not enough to justify any stance[/left]\n     but total
      agreement with whatever your Armsmaster[/left]\n     says, a man who has dedicated
      his life to strategy?[/left]\n b)  Disagree with his remark, reasoning that
      it must be[/left]\n     some type of test, and that the truth will only come[/left]\n    
      from opposition with his opinion, and not sheep-like[/left]\n     agreement?[/left]\n
      c)  Refuse to answer the question, choosing to withhold an[/left]\n     opinion
      until you have more experience and can[/left]\n     converse on the subject
      in an intelligent manner with[/left]\n     him?[/left]\n {15.    The senior
      student in your weapons class has[/left]\n     trounced you unmercifully for
      the past several years.[/left]\n     Today is the Tournament of Students and
      you find with[/left]\n     dismay that you are paired against him for your
      first[/left]\n     match. As you prepare your friend approaches and[/left]\n    
      offers to tell you of an injury the senior student[/left]\n     suffered in
      yesterday's sparring class, which you[/left]\n     missed. Do you:[/left]\n
      a)  Accept the offer, knowing that it would allow you to[/left]\n     concentrate
      on the injured area and greatly increase[/left]\n     your chances of beating
      him?[/left]\n b)  Refuse the offer, knowing that win or lose you would[/left]\n    
      rather do it through your own skill and not some extra[/left]\n     knowledge
      in what should be a fair and honorable[/left]\n     fight?[/left]\n c)  Accept
      the offer, reasoning that it is better to have[/left]\n     the knowledge in
      case you need it, and realizing that[/left]\n     having the knowledge does
      not necessarily mean using[/left]\n     it?[/left]\n {16.    An old man stops
      you on the way to market,[/left]\n     claiming to have been robbed. He is
      lying on the trail[/left]\n     and seems gravely injured. He asks you to run
      to town[/left]\n     and get the constable. You give him your word that you[/left]\n    
      will go directly to town and bring the constable back.[/left]\n     As you
      make your way back you notice a suspicious man[/left]\n     creeping along
      another trail. He doesn't seem to[/left]\n     notice you yet. Do you:[/left]\n
      a)  Follow the man, reasoning that if this man is the[/left]\n     robber you
      could lead the constable directly to him[/left]\n     and safeguard other travelers,
      although it would mean[/left]\n     breaking your word?[/left]\n b)  Take note
      of him but continue on, reasoning that the[/left]\n     man on the trail is
      hurt too badly to stop, regardless[/left]\n     of any other consideration?[/left]\n
      c)  Take note of him but continue on, reasoning that your[/left]\n     word
      is your bond and that it takes precedence over[/left]\n     anything else?[/left]\n
      {17.    While fishing one sunny afternoon you find that the[/left]\n     boots
      which you discarded are now full of ants who are[/left]\n     busily making
      their way from a piece of bread you[/left]\n     dropped to their anthill.
      Do you:[/left]\n a)  Pick up the boots wash all the ants off now, even[/left]\n    
      though you are not leaving until dusk?[/left]\n b)  Watch the ants, curious
      as to how they work so[/left]\n     efficiently, and content to live and let
      live?[/left]\n c)  Make boats out of leaves and then send each ant down[/left]\n    
      the stream to pass the time until a fish bites?[/left]\n {18.    You hear the
      Armsmaster remark during weapons[/left]\n     class, 'The intent of your opponent
      can be seen in his[/left]\n     blade'. Many of the students scoff at this,
      though not[/left]\n     openly. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Feel that the disrespect
      the students show at this[/left]\n     points to something which they do not
      understand, and[/left]\n     therefore causes you to focus your efforts on[/left]\n    
      understanding it all the more?[/left]\n b)  Feel that he means the way the
      opponent attacks and[/left]\n     moves shows you how he feels?[/left]\n c) 
      Realize that Armsmaster Festil should not be the[/left]\n     object of scorn,
      but rather one of respect, for he has[/left]\n     lived a full life and survived
      things none of the[/left]\n     students could imagine?[/left]\n {19.    The
      town has a lottery in which the winning chit[/left]\n     is called. You look
      in shock as the winning chit[/left]\n     number matches your own! Before you
      can say anything[/left]\n     another family walks forward. You have seen them
      before[/left]\n     and know that they are extremely poor. Your family on[/left]\n    
      the other hand could do without the 100 gold piece[/left]\n     prize. Do you:[/left]\n
      a)  Say nothing and allow the other family to claim the[/left]\n     prize?[/left]\n
      b)  Stand and show your chit, knowing that the prize is[/left]\n     rightfully
      yours?[/left]\n c)  Stand and show your chit, and offer to split the prize[/left]\n    
      in half with the other family?[/left]\n {20.    Your Armsmaster poses a question
      one day to his[/left]\n     class. A company of 100 men is attempting to flee
      from[/left]\n     the enemy. There are two paths out of the broken[/left]\n    
      stronghold. One path will kill half the men under the[/left]\n     officers
      command, but the other half would survive. The[/left]\n     other path has
      a fifty percent chance that everyone[/left]\n     would die, but also a fifty
      percent chance that[/left]\n     everyone would survive. As the commanding
      officer,[/left]\n     would you:[/left]\n a)  Choose the path that would guarantee
      half your men[/left]\n     would survive?[/left]\n b)  Choose the path that
      has a fifty percent chance that[/left]\n     all would survive, and a fifty
      percent chance that all[/left]\n     would perish?[/left]\n c)  Turn the choice
      over to the men and let them decide by[/left]\n     majority vote which path
      they should commit[/left]\n     themselves to?[/left]\n {21.    You have a
      great aunt and a great uncle living in[/left]\n     two different nearby villages,
      both of whom have asked[/left]\n     your father to allow you to live with
      them for a few[/left]\n     weeks.[/left]\n     Your father knows where he
      plans to send you, but he[/left]\n     is curious about your opinion. Given
      the choice, would[/left]\n     you rather:[/left]\n a)  Live with your great
      aunt -- a wise old woman of[/left]\n     considerable wealth. Living in luxury
      for a few weeks[/left]\n     could not only be enlightening, it could also
      be very[/left]\n     interesting.[/left]\n b)  Live with your great uncle --
      a sick old man who has[/left]\n     always been something of a stranger to
      you. A few[/left]\n     weeks with him may be ardorous, but he is in more need[/left]\n    
      of your help than your great aunt.[/left]\n c)  Think of a way to divide your
      time between your great[/left]\n     aunt and great uncle. Perhaps you will
      not be able to[/left]\n     spend as much time with either as much as you would[/left]\n    
      like, but neither would be left out.[/left]\n {22.    A friend has on several
      occassions made remarks[/left]\n     about how much he likes a particular gold
      ring of[/left]\n     yours. One day you discover that this ring is missing[/left]\n    
      and after making a thorough search, find it in a coat[/left]\n     your friend
      had left in your pantry. Are you most[/left]\n     inclined to: a)  Ask your
      friend how he came about the ring, reasoning[/left]\n     that it is highly
      probable that he found it and meant[/left]\n     to return it to you.[/left]\n
      b)  Confront him with his theft. You know that there is no[/left]\n     way
      the ring just fell into his pocket by accident,[/left]\n     and therefore
      he is nothing but a common thief who[/left]\n     would betray you for material
      gain.[/left]\n c)  Say nothing, deciding instead to wait and see what[/left]\n    
      your friend does. If he is innocent or guilty, you[/left]\n     will know by
      whatever actions he takes. At that time,[/left]\n     you can confront him
      with the truth.[/left]\n {23.    A good friend of yours is in love with a girl
      from[/left]\n     a neighboring village, a girl who barely knows him. He[/left]\n    
      is extremely shy and inexperienced, and he pleads for[/left]\n     your help.
      Would you suggest he:[/left]\n a)  Go to her immediately and declare his love.
      If the[/left]\n     relationship is to be, he needs to be honest from the[/left]\n    
      start. You offer to accompany him to the village for[/left]\n     support.[/left]\n
      b)  Find out more about this girl using any contact he can[/left]\n     find
      in her village. He will not be so shy if he knows[/left]\n     something about
      her, and may even find out she is not[/left]\n     the right girl for him.[/left]\n
      c)  Let you help him write anonymous love letters and[/left]\n     poems to
      see her reaction without needing to face her[/left]\n     directly. If the
      reaction is favorable, he can talk to[/left]\n     her friends in the village
      and arrange an \"accidental\"[/left]\n     meeting.[/left]\n {24.    Your Armmaster
      is relating the story of a great[/left]\n     king he knew in a faraway land
      whose inventors created[/left]\n     a wondrous balloon of such size, it could
      transport[/left]\n     dozens of people through the air to any place they[/left]\n    
      chose. If you were this king, he asks you, how would[/left]\n     you use this
      remarkable balloon? Would you:[/left]\n a)  Explore regions previously impossible
      or extremely[/left]\n     dangerous to visit by land.[/left]\n b)  Keep the
      balloon a secret, saving it for surprise[/left]\n     attacks or defense in
      a time of war.[/left]\n c)  Commission the inventor to create dozens of these[/left]\n    
      'balloons' in hopes of making a travel system across[/left]\n     your realm
      that will speed up transportation time and[/left]\n     the exchange of ideas.[/left]\n
      {25.    There is a lot of heated discussion at the local[/left]\n     tavern
      over a group of people called 'Telepaths'. They[/left]\n     have been hired
      by certain City-State kings. Rumor has[/left]\n     it these Telepaths read
      a person's mind and tell their[/left]\n     lord whether a follower is telling
      the truth or not.[/left]\n     You believe:[/left]\n a)  That this is a terrible
      practice. A person's thoughts[/left]\n     are his own and no one, not even
      a king, has the right[/left]\n     to make such an invasion into another human's
      mind.[/left]\n b)  Loyal followers to the King have nothing to fear from[/left]\n    
      a Telepath. It is important to have a method of[/left]\n     finding assassins
      and spies before it is too late.[/left]\n c)  In these times, it is a necessary
      evil. Although you[/left]\n     do not necessarily like the idea, a Telepath
      could[/left]\n     have certain advantages during a time of war or in[/left]\n    
      finding someone innocent of a crime.[/left]\n {26.    You are told that a young
      man has been caught by[/left]\n     the village guards and accused of murder.
      Apparently,[/left]\n     his brother was killed by a group of four ruffians
      in[/left]\n     a local tavern, and in his grief, the young man[/left]\n    
      tracked each of them down and murdered them. Upon[/left]\n     reflection,
      you believe that:[/left]\n a)  The young man acted honorably in avenging his[/left]\n    
      brother's death. The village lord should let him go[/left]\n     free. b) 
      Even as you sympathize with the young man, vigilante[/left]\n     law cannot
      be tolerated if there is to be peace.[/left]\n c)  The young man's only mistake
      was getting caught while[/left]\n     exacting vengance. For that, he now must
      accept[/left]\n     whatever fate has in store for him.[/left]\n {27.    One
      night, walking home, you are attacked by a[/left]\n     young man you know
      from class. You defend yourself[/left]\n     ably and knock him unconscious.
      While he is out, you:[/left]\n a)  Tie him up, intending to interrogate him
      later when he[/left]\n     wakes up. You want to know why he attacked you.
      You[/left]\n     can then turn him into the Armsmaster at your leisure.[/left]\n
      b)  Slit his throat. You know him from class, and think he[/left]\n     would
      have done the same had your positions been[/left]\n     reversed.[/left]\n
      c)  Leave him with a visible scar, the knowledge of his[/left]\n     defeat
      at your hands and the visible reminder[/left]\n     punishment enough for one
      who has resorted to such[/left]\n     dishonorable tactics.[/left]\n {28.   
      Your father delights in telling you stories of his[/left]\n     travels in
      his youth. In one memorable tale, he tells[/left]\n     you about a primitive
      island he visited where a young[/left]\n     child was sacrificed once a year
      to appease Arius, the[/left]\n     God of Fire. Whenever the natives neglected
      the[/left]\n     sacrifice, the island volcano would erupt, killing[/left]\n    
      hundreds of villagers. You tell your father:[/left]\n a)  You do not believe
      in any such Volcano God. Civilized[/left]\n     men should intervene, find
      the natural cause behind[/left]\n     the eruptions, and stop the sacrifices.[/left]\n
      b)  The God Arius must be evil to demand child sacrifice.[/left]\n     The
      villagers should find some way to combat this God,[/left]\n     instead of
      just giving in to his demands.[/left]\n c)  It is tragic, but the death of
      one small child is[/left]\n     preferable to that of many villagers. If it
      works,[/left]\n     they should keep the tradition. Gods are not to be[/left]\n    
      toyed with.[/left]\n {29.    Your Armsmaster introduces a new student to the[/left]\n    
      class - a small, awkward boy named Tys who does not[/left]\n     seem to have
      any natural talent at all. The class is[/left]\n     divided into two sides
      for a mock battle and, as one of[/left]\n     the 'generals', you are to assign
      your soldiers. Tys[/left]\n     is one of your men. You decide to:[/left]\n
      a)  Put Tys at the frontline with the other fighters,[/left]\n     rationalizing
      that in any realistic battle, he would[/left]\n     probably be a casualty
      anyway, and that there must be[/left]\n     some sacrifices.[/left]\n b)  Use
      Tys as a scout, rationalizing that because of his[/left]\n     small size he
      would probably be good at sneaking in[/left]\n     and gathering information
      on the enemy.[/left]\n c)  Assign Tys to several posts during the course of
      the[/left]\n     battle, staying near and helping him so he can gain[/left]\n    
      valuable experience and improve.[/left]\n {30.    Your mother is terribly ill
      and you have been sent[/left]\n     with a few gold pieces to buy some rare,
      medicinal[/left]\n     herbs for her. As you reach the door to the[/left]\n    
      apothecary's, you realize there is a hole in your purse[/left]\n     and all
      the gold has fallen out. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Enter the store, tell the apothecary
      your dilemma, and[/left]\n     promise on your honor to pay him back for the
      herbs[/left]\n     your mother so desperately needs.[/left]\n b)  Attempt to
      steal the herbs from the apothecary's. You[/left]\n     know the old man who
      works in the store will not be[/left]\n     able to catch you, and your mother
      lies sick.[/left]\n c)  Run back home and admit the loss, hoping that your[/left]\n    
      father will have more gold. You know you'll be[/left]\n     punished, but you
      will neither be in debt to the[/left]\n     apothecary, nor will you be a thief.[/left]\n
      {31.    A boat you are in is suddenly caught in a[/left]\n     tremendous whirlpool.
      As the current reaches an[/left]\n     impossible velocity, the little boat
      begins springing[/left]\n     leaks and starts to sink under the vortex. You
      can see[/left]\n     no way out that does not promise death, so you:[/left]\n
      a)  Pick up a bucket and begin bailing furiously, hoping[/left]\n     to keep
      the boat afloat just a few more seconds.[/left]\n b)  Sit back and accept your
      fate, choosing to die with a[/left]\n     sense of decorum and nobility, not
      as a commoner who[/left]\n     fears the unknown.[/left]\n c)  Dive into the
      churning current. You may only be[/left]\n     hastening your own death, but
      at least you are doing[/left]\n     something.[/left]\n {32.    You're hunting
      in the King's Hunt, a contest in[/left]\n     which the best hunter will win
      riches enough to live[/left]\n     comfortably for the rest of his or her life.
      You track[/left]\n     a white stag many of you had shot at earlier. You are[/left]\n    
      alone as you examine the stag and recognize the arrow[/left]\n     as one fired
      from your friend's bow. As you retrieve[/left]\n     the arrow for closer examination
      you hear your friends[/left]\n     arrive. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Claim to have
      fired the arrow that hit the stag, thus[/left]\n     gaining the honor for
      the kill?[/left]\n b)  Show the others the arrow and proclaim your friend the[/left]\n    
      archer of the day?[/left]\n c)  Suggest dividing the prize, reasoning that
      although[/left]\n     your friend's arrow brought down the hart, all of you[/left]\n    
      were instrumental in the tracking and the kill?[/left]\n {33.    One night
      after Tales and Tallows, you look at the[/left]\n     horde of treats you have
      collected and find lots of[/left]\n     brandied plums, a treat you particularly
      dislike. You[/left]\n     know your younger cousin likes them. Do you:[/left]\n
      a)  Give her all your brandied plums?[/left]\n b)  Trade the brandied plums
      for something she does not[/left]\n     really like but you do?[/left]\n c) 
      Pretend that they are excellent brandied plums and see[/left]\n     if she
      will give up something really good in exchange?[/left]\n {34.    Your cousin
      has given you a very embarassing[/left]\n     nickname and, even worse, likes
      to call you it in front[/left]\n     of your friends. You have asked him to
      stop, but he[/left]\n     finds it very amusing to watch you blush. What do
      you     do?:[/left]\n a)  Make up an even more embarassing nickname for him
      and[/left]\n     use it constantly until he learns his lesson.[/left]\n b) 
      Make up a story that makes your nickname a badge of[/left]\n     honor instead
      of something humiliating.[/left]\n c)  Beat up your cousin, then tell him that
      if he ever[/left]\n     calls you that nickname again, you will bloody him[/left]\n    
      worse than this time.[/left]\n {35.    Othisa, a friend, has been beaten by
      a boy several[/left]\n     years older than either you or her. She asks for
      your[/left]\n     help. Are you more inclined to:[/left]\n a)  Gather a bunch
      of friends together and ambush the boy,[/left]\n     teaching him a lesson
      about bullying.[/left]\n b)  Tell Othisa to avoid the bully - no reason to
      make[/left]\n     things worse than they are.[/left]\n c)  Challenge the older
      boy, knowing that you will[/left]\n     probably take a beating, but confident
      that if you do[/left]\n     it enough times, he will move on to pick on someone[/left]\n    
      who is an easier target.[/left]\n {36.    Your parents are having a party for
      several[/left]\n     relatives. While helping around the house, you see your[/left]\n    
      cousin slip into a darkened room. Curious, you follow[/left]\n     and discover
      him slipping a silver candlestick into his[/left]\n     jacket. He is an honorable
      boy, but you know his family[/left]\n     has suffered some recent financial
      hardship. He has not[/left]\n     seen you yet. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Clear
      your throat and tell him to put the candlestick[/left]\n     back, reassuring
      him that your parents can help him if[/left]\n     his family is in trouble,
      but he should not resort [/left]\n     to stealing.[/left]\n b)  Close the
      door behind you and say nothing. Your family[/left]\n     can live without
      the candlestick, but your cousin's[/left]\n     family obviously cannot.[/left]\n
      c)  Treat him like any other burgler. Lock him in the room[/left]\n     and
      call for your father. If he chooses to be merciful[/left]\n     because of
      your cousin's poverty, that is his decision.[/left]\n     It is your father's
      candlestick, after all.[/left]\n {37.    While exploring the woods with two
      other[/left]\n     adventurers, you come across a small, abandoned hut[/left]\n    
      that seems to have once belonged to a mage. Looking[/left]\n     through the
      window, you see the remains of a[/left]\n     laboratory, many potions and
      scrolls still on the[/left]\n     shelves. Geotina, who thinks you a cowardly
      sort,[/left]\n     suggests breaking into the shack and exploring. Another[/left]\n    
      fighter named Hunard suggests going to town to find out[/left]\n     more information.
      You advise:[/left]\n a)  Going into town. They are more familiar with the area[/left]\n    
      and may have important information about this hut and[/left]\n     the surrounding
      area.[/left]\n b)  Breaking into the shack, but leaving one person on[/left]\n    
      the outside in case something goes wrong. You should[/left]\n     investigate
      new things, not run away from them.[/left]\n c)  Daring Geotina to go in first.
      If there is a trap, she[/left]\n     can trip it, then you and Hunard can go
      in and explore[/left]\n     at your leisure.[/left]\n {38.    It is a particularly
      grueling class. Your[/left]\n     Armsmaster has been unreasonably demanding
      on everyone,[/left]\n     including you. His criticisms border on abuse, and
      it[/left]\n     seems he has no positive comments to make. He turns to[/left]\n    
      berate you at the end of class, and over his shoulder,[/left]\n     you see
      some classmates put an aggressive but[/left]\n     non-poisonous snake in his
      hand sack. You would:[/left]\n a)  Do nothing. The great Armsmaster needs a
      dose of[/left]\n     humility and this might be a good way of paying him[/left]\n    
      back for all the misery he has put you through today.[/left]\n b)  Tell him
      you saw a snake creep into his hand sack,[/left]\n     but do not tell him
      what your classmates did. No[/left]\n     reason to get anyone in even further
      trouble.[/left]\n c)  Immediately tell him what the classmates did. There[/left]\n    
      is no excuse for treating a seasoned fighter like him[/left]\n     with disrespect,
      regardless of his treatment to you[/left]\n     that particular day.[/left]\n
      {39.    Because you expressed interest, your Armsmaster[/left]\n     told you
      a few hints about recognizing magical[/left]\n     weaponry. Later you are
      practicing archery with a few[/left]\n     friends. One boy who was never a
      strong archer has[/left]\n     become something of a sharpshooter. You suddenly[/left]\n    
      realize that he is using magical arrows. What do you[/left]\n     do?:[/left]\n
      a)  Tell the others about the arrows. In a friendly[/left]\n     archery match,
      using magical arrows is cheating.[/left]\n b)  Tell your friend you noticed
      that he was using magical[/left]\n     arrows, and if he doesn't get you some,
      you will tell[/left]\n     the Armsmaster and the others the reason behind
      his[/left]\n     improvement.[/left]\n c)  Say nothing. If you have a need
      for magical arrows[/left]\n     you can always mention something to him later.
      After[/left]\n     all, magic is not really a cheat, it is a different[/left]\n    
      skill.[/left]\n {40.    Practicing alone, you develop a new fighting style[/left]\n    
      you are very excited about. When you mention it to your[/left]\n     Armsmaster,
      he tells you it would never work in[/left]\n     practical combat. Do you:[/left]\n
      a)  Use the new style in the middle of a class spar.[/left]\n     When it works,
      he will be forced to admit its[/left]\n     practicality or give a reason for
      not accepting it.[/left]\n b)  Keep asking him questions about it, focusing
      on[/left]\n     details of the form to find his objection. Eventually[/left]\n    
      he will have to give a more specific criticism.[/left]\n c)  Accept his word
      without question. Your Armsmaster has[/left]\n     been fighting since your
      grandfather's day. He knows a[/left]\n     flawed style when he sees it, and
      it is better not to[/left]\n     waste his or your time asking why.[/left]\n
