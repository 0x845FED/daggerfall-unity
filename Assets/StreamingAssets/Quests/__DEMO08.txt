Dear %pcn,
 
     I heard about your accident at sea, and feared the
 worst. Now that I've heard you're alive and well, I
 would like the opportunity to meet with you and discuss
 our beloved Emperor's mission in the Iliac Bay.
 
     Allow me to introduce myself. I am Lady Magnessen,
 the Emperor's agent in the court of Daggerfall. My
 position is not so official as an ambassador. None but
 other agents of the Emperor know of my true affiliation.
 The Iliac Bay is rife with rebels against the Imperial
 throne, so your discretion is required.
 
     For the purpose of our meeting, I will take a room
 at an inn, _dirtypit_ in __dirtypit_
 of Daggerfall, for a month. After that, I will no longer
 be available. I will expect you as soon as possible.
 
<ce>                            Yours sincerely,
 
<ce>                       Brisienna, Lady Magnessen
