<ce>              Ah, thank you for responding to my letter,
<ce>                     %pcf. I am Lady Brisienna. Let
<ce>              me bring you to date on affairs. The spectre
<ce>                 of King Lysandus haunts the streets of
<ce>               Daggerfall at night. Trying to communicate
<ce>                with him is futile. He will occasionally
<ce>               moan the word "Vengeance," but that is the
<ce>                only coherent word I have ever heard him
<ce>              utter. If you are ever in Daggerfall, do not
<ce>              wander the city at night. You are certain to
<ce>                  be attacked by his legion of ghosts.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                  It would be probably more gainful to
<ce>                investigate those who might have wronged
<ce>             Lysandus to find the cause behind his torment.
<ce>            I do not know if the royal family of Daggerfall
<ce>                or another person or persons merit more
<ce>                suspicion. The major powers of the Bay,
<ce>                Sentinel, Wayrest, and Daggerfall may be
<ce>                         good places to start.
<ce>                             (continued...)

<ce>              In the matter of the letter, the Emperor's
<ce>             agent says that he was unable to hand-deliver
<ce>             it to the Queen because of the war. He hired a
<ce>              courier who supposedly delivered the letter
<ce>             in his stead. We do not even know the name of
<ce>                this courier. Obviously, there is little
<ce>             information of use, but it would be worthwhile
<ce>              to see whether the letter arrived at Castle
<ce>              Daggerfall at all. How you decide to do this
<ce>             is entirely your decision. I will contact you
<ce>                 if any new information should surface.
<ce>                                    
<ce>             I am leaving Daggerfall soon. My position has
<ce>              here has been compromised and my life is in
<ce>              danger. Do not mention my name in court. It
<ce>              is more likely to hurt than help. Good luck,
<ce>                       and watch your back, %pcf.

Message:  1020
Dear %pcn,
 
     I heard about your accident at sea, and feared the
 worst. Now that I've heard you're alive and well, I
 would like the opportunity to meet with you and discuss
 our beloved Emperor's mission in the Iliac Bay.
 
     Allow me to introduce myself. I am Lady Magnessen,
 the Emperor's agent in the court of Daggerfall. My
 position is not so official as an ambassador. None but
 other agents of the Emperor know of my true affiliation.
 The Iliac Bay is rife with rebels against the Imperial
 throne, so your discretion is required.
 
     For the purpose of our meeting, I will take a room
 at an inn, _dirtypit_ in __dirtypit_
 of Daggerfall, for a month. After that, I will no longer
 be available. I will expect you as soon as possible.
 
<ce>                            Yours sincerely,
 
<ce>                       Brisienna, Lady Magnessen

<ce>             You approached by a young page who smiles in
<ce>             recognition and does not ask your name before
<ce>               he hands you a letter addressed to you. To
<ce>               all of your questions, he merely responds
<ce>                     with a blank look and a smile.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A letter is pressed into your hand. You spin
<ce>             to see who gave it to you. You catch a glimpse
<ce>                of livery that vanishes into the crowd.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A page steps forward saying "Letter for you
<ce>                      %pcn," and hands you a note.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A courier steps up to you with a letter in
<ce>                hand. "I was told to give this letter to
<ce>                someone fitting your description," says
<ce>                the courier. As you take it, the courier
<ce>                     turns and walks quickly away.
                                     <--->
<ce>                Reaching into you pack for something to
<ce>              eat, you spy a note. It wasn't there before.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A redfaced courier startles you with a cry of
<ce>                   "Letter for %pcn! Hey that must be
<ce>                 you. Here, take this. Gotta go. Other
<ce>                         deliveries to be made.
