<ce>                     Hello, %pcn, you need a job?
<ce>             If you were available for a little guard duty
<ce>                you could earn yourself some goldpieces
<ce>             tonight. One of the local nobles has invited
<ce>          friends for a feast, and they need someone to guard
<ce>              the valuables, including the pretty ladies!
<ce>                   Are you available tonight, %pcf?
                                     <--->
<ce>               %pcn! Would you be available to play the
<ce>                   bouncer at _partyhouse_ tonight?
<ce>                 Pay is the usual, you might meet some
<ce>              interesting people there! You want the job?
                                     <--->
<ce>                 Hey I have an easy job for you, %pcf!
<ce>               There is a some sort of celebration going
<ce>               on tonight, and they need someone to keep
<ce>                 watch at the door. That's easy money,
<ce>                don't you think? For =gold_ goldpieces?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          No? I should have mentioned that there is free beer
<ce>                    for guards after duty, I guess.

<ce>                Ok. The party starts at 18:00 tonight,
<ce>                 and you are expected there no later!

<ce>                         explain your duties.
<ce>                      The venue is _partyhouse_.
                                     <--->
<ce>                        You will do it? Great!
<ce>                       Go to _partyhouse_ at 6pm
<ce>                   to meet _partyman_, he will give
<ce>                 you instructions. Not that the job is
<ce>                          very complicated...

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Some trouble at the party, I heard?
<ce>             Well, good that they had a professional guard
<ce>                       from the fighters guild!

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
 You helped us to improve our standing with 
 _partyman_. What may I do for you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
 That party didn't work out quite the

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
___qgiver_, %qdt:
 I was hired as a guard for a party at 
 _partyhouse_ by _qgiver_
 of the fighters guild.
 I should be there at 6pm tonight 
 and talk to _partyman_ 
 who will explain my duties.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      _partyman_ approaches you:
<ce>           Not a very exiting party! Everybody left already!
<ce>             Well thank you for keeping an eye on things.
<ce>                      _qgiver_ will pay you and I
<ce>                   will recommend you to my friends.

<ce>                      _partyman_ approaches you:
<ce>               Well I had a great evening! Not the least
<ce>                  thanks to your watchfulness, %pcf.
<ce>                              Well done!

Message:  1012
<ce>           Ah the guard has arrived! Well, you know how this
<ce>         works, right? If any aggressive do no goods show up,
<ce>         You ask them to leave. If they don´t leave you throw
<ce>        them out, if you cant throw them out, use your weapon.
                                     <--->
<ce>              So you are the bouncer? Well get over there
<ce>             and watch the door. Don't let anyone in that
<ce>             does not have an invitation! And don't let me
<ce>                 catch you being rough with my guests!

Message:  1013
<ce>                       _partyman_ yells at you:
<ce>              Cant you deal with such things swiftly and
<ce>                            quietly, %oth!
<ce>              Now all my friends have fled _partyhouse_.
<ce>             I will not pay for such an amateurish guard!

Message:  1014
<ce>          In fact I was impressed with the way you fulfilled
<ce>              Your duty. Take this ring and buy yourself
<ce>                               a drink!

Message:  1015
<ce>                     You missed your assignment at
<ce>                             _partyhouse_.
<ce>               _qgiver_ will not be pleased about this.

Message:  1016
<ce>                          All quiet, so far.

Message:  1020

<ce>                   yell. You are one of those right?
<ce>              Well you cant stop me from having some fun!

Message:  1051
<ce>                       Damn, they hired a guard!
<ce>                   I am sorry, but if you dont want
<ce>                   to let me go, I will have to cut
<ce>                             your throat.
<ce>                                   -
<ce>                    Are you letting the thief flee?

Message:  1055
<ce>                     The old monk screams in pain.
<ce>                "Hey, that was just a misunderstanding,
<ce>                        I didn't mean no harm!
<ce>              Please, let an old beggarman stay here and
<ce>                    beg, Its doing no one no harm."

Message:  1056
<ce>                Thank you so much! May %god bless you!
<ce>                 I will just stay there in the shadows
<ce>               and remain out of your sights, good lord.

Message:  1057
<ce>              No? well, I will make you feel the wrath of
<ce>                          %god, you imbecile!

Message:  1058
<ce>                  _partyman_ approaches you, looking
<ce>                  quite distraught. %pcf, one of the
<ce>                     guest, _guest_, has collpsed!
<ce>                   Probably just too much drink, but
<ce>                          %g looks all pale.
<ce>                  Would you carry %g2 to _hospital_?
<ce>                I would be very grateful if you could.
<ce>                I think none of us is strong enough to
<ce>                  carry %g2 all the way. Hurry, %pcf!
                                     <--->
<ce>              Suddenly you notice that one of the guests
<ce>            is in trouble. _guest_ suddenly starts to sway
<ce>                 and falls to his knees moments later.
<ce>             As you bend down to him he grabs your sleeve.
<ce>                "I ate too much of those mushrooms from
<ce>             Morrowind... Please help me! I cant breathe!"
<ce>              The host, _partyman_ looks at the fainting
<ce>                        figure and than at you:
<ce>                    "Quick! get him to _hospital_!"

Message:  1059
<ce>                    You wont? I will remember that.

Message:  1060
<ce>                One of the priest takes _guest_ out of
<ce>                              your arms.
<ce>                "Whatever %g took it was strong stuff,
<ce>                     too strong for %g2 it seems.
<ce>                    And too much wine on top of it!
<ce>             Well, I believe we will be able to heal %g2."

Message:  1061
<ce>              _guest_s breath comes in gasps and %g3 eyes
<ce>          glaze over. Suddenly %g shudders and falls silent.
<ce>                           _guest_ is dead.
<ce>                    _partyman_ steps up behind you.
<ce>                "%oth. Well the party is over, I guess.
<ce>                      You can go home now, %pcf.
<ce>                   I wish you could have run faster
<ce>                      and we might have made it."

Message:  1063
<ce>                  Right behind you _partyman_ enters.
<ce>               After a brief discussion with the priest.
<ce>                           %g turns to you.
<ce>                 "I am indeed grateful for your help,
<ce>                      %pcn. I hope I can count on
<ce>                   your discretion too. Take this as
<ce>                  gold as payment for your troubles,
<ce>             and this gem for saving the life of a friend,
<ce>               I hope our paths will cross again, %pcf."
