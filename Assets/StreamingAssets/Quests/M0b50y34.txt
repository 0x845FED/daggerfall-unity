<ce>                     Always good to see you, %pcf!
<ce>            Listen, %pcf, this is kind of a strange story.
<ce>             The priests of _temple_ are having a problem
<ce>         with some "abhorrent abominations"  -as they put it-
<ce>          haunting their temple. Well obviously the deceased
<ce>                     patrons of _temple_ that were
<ce>            buried in the temple's crypt are not at peace.
<ce>           Strangely enough they do not attack the priests,
<ce>              but for the order they represent a terrible
<ce>               sacrilege, and they are not so courteous
<ce>                as not to attack the faithful visitors.
<ce>         Well, since the priests efforts to dispel the undead
<ce>                 were unsuccessful, they approached us
<ce>             to apply a less subtle method to put the dead
<ce>          back where they belong. Pay is _gold_ gold, and if
<ce>            you are nice they will probably reward you with
<ce>             some holy reliquary that is worth much more.
<ce>                    do you want to help them, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     Obviously you do not care for
<ce>                  _temple_. I know that undead are a
<ce>               smelly, unpleasant lot, but I can't offer
<ce>               you to slay dragons every day, you know?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Well then, you gotta go to __temple_.
<ce>             Go there and kill the walking dead once more.
<ce>            Your deadline on this one is =questtime_ days.
<ce>         I guess the priest will be able to tell you when you
<ce>                     found and killed all of them.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                    Oh, and a word of advice, %pcf,
<ce>              watch your back! Not because of the undead,
<ce>                I trust you know how to deal with them.
<ce>               But the whole story reeks of necromancy,
<ce>             and that is a dangerous affair to meddle in.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Did you ever find out what raised the
<ce>                     undead in that temple, %pcf?

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
 _temple_! I will not set foot there
 again! They are in league with the Necromancers!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
 All is quiet in Daggerfall
<--->
 An army of undead has attacked %reg. They were
 beaten, but at great cost of lives.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 I heard the Fighters Guild sent some
<ce>                  %ra over to kill the undead in that
<ce>                                temple.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>           Welcome, %pcf. You are one of our most successful
<ce>             members by now. I hope you dont want my job?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>              The temple ended up hiring the mages guild.
<ce>           Cost them a lot more, but they got the job done.

 The Fighters Guild of ___questgiver_
 has asked me fight some undead in 
 _temple_ in __temple_.
 I have =questtime_ days to report back to
 _questgiver_ in the guild.

<ce>                It is too late now to claim the reward
<ce>                 for fighting the undead in _temple_.

Message:  1012
<ce>                    You must be %pcn. I am _priest_
<ce>                   of ==priest_. I came here to help
<ce>                  these brothers against the undead.
<ce>                   But we were helpless, a powerful
<ce>               will seemed to protect the walking dead.
<ce>                   I don't know why they haunt this
<ce>                  temple, but it seems they have been
<ce>                 searching for something in the crypt.
<ce>              Here, take this Holy Relic as a sign of the
<ce>                   deepest gratitude from _temple_.

Message:  1013
<ce>                           They are coming!

 In __mondung_ I have found and killed
 an ancient lich-king. The place was swarming
 with undead, but the evil will that possessed 
 them vanished when the lich died.

Message:  1015
<ce>                  This place has a foul smell to it.

<ce>              This is the reward the priest in __temple_

<ce>                       A priest approaches you:
<ce>                 That's apparently all of them, I have
<ce>                      not seen any others around.
<ce>                  _temple_ will not forget your deed!

<ce>               After a last fearful blow the evil light
<ce>                  fades from the eyes of the undead.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                   With an eerie voice it whispers:
<ce>                                    
<ce>                       "Cold is bone and marrow
<ce>                        dark the hidden barrow
<ce>                 where the one with steel crowned head
<ce>                     made awake the sleeping dead
<ce>                   To his decay shall fall the land
<ce>                   in __mondung_ he raised his hand"

 I have fulfilled my contract 
 with _temple_, but
 I am feeling uneasy.
 The dying undead cited a strange verse:
 "Cold is bone and marrow
 dark the hidden barrow
 where the one with steel crowned head
 made awake the sleeping dead
 To his decay shall fall the land
 in __mondung_ he raised his hand"

Message:  1032
<ce>               On the brittle parchment you can make out
<ce>           a map, drawn in dark lines and adorned with many
<ce>        illegible runes. But you are able to make out the word
<ce>                  "__mondung_" and next to it "King"
<ce>                                    
<ce>           Attempting to turn the page to see if anything is
<ce>           written on the other side, the parchment crumbles
<ce>                            in your hands.

Message:  1033

 I found a strange map, that must have come from one
 of the undead. It revealed the name of 
 __mondung_.

Message:  1034
<ce>                  You, a mere mortal, dare attack me?

<ce>                              my General!

Message:  1035
<ce>           As the lich-king dies, you feel his evil presence
