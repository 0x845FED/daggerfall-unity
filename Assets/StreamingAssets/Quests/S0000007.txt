QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 Hey, if I told you I could give you a
<ce>                  bit of information, let's say, about
<ce>                  that letter of milady, would you be
<ce>                   innerested there, %pcf? I thought
<ce>                   so. Now, mind you, I ain't givin'
<ce>                  it away. Before I scratch yer back,
 you gotta scratch mine. Deal?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Of course not. You only do work for
<ce>                   the likes of kings, don't ya? Poor
<ce>                  Cyndassa has to work for herself, is
<ce>                     that it? Well, %oth, it suits
<ce>                        me just fine, so there.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            Me name is Cyndassa. Daggerfall. I'll tell you
<ce>             everything I know, but I don't need to remind
<ce>            you that there ain't no such thing as free info,
<ce>                     do I, %pcn? I'm just a maid to
<ce>            her highness, nothing but a fleck to the world,
<ce>         and my needs ain't big. I need this werewolf done in.
<ce>              I know just where it is -- some %god forsook
<ce>                    hole called ___mondung_. I can't
<ce>            tell you why, but it's important to me that that
<ce>           werewolf gets put outta its misery. I'll wait here
<ce>             for =2mondung_ days for you -- that oughta be
<ce>                            plenty of time.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     You think I'm an idiot, %pct?
<ce>                  You think I don't know that loop is
<ce>                              still alive?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>           It's dead then, is it? Poor thing. He used to be
<ce>              my brother. If you ask me, he died long ago,
<ce>            when he first got bit. He hated himself when he
<ce>             became that beast. I wish there'd been another
<ce>                            way to help him.
<ce>                                    
<ce>             I promised I'd tell you about that letter yer
<ce>            lookin for, didn't I now? Of course, I remember
<ce>                   that letter, %pcf. It's not every
<ce>              day that you gets a letter from the Emperor
<ce>              himself, especially seein' as the King ain't
<ce>             too fond of him. 'Fact, that's the only letter
<ce>            I ever seen from him. I give it to her majesty,
<ce>             and she's all excited and she rip it open and
<ce>             says "this isn't for me, this is addressed to
<ce>             Mynisera." Then... boom! Her jaw fall open and
<ce>              her eyes get real wide. She say she'll make
<ce>             sure the Queen Mother gets it and that I don't
<ce>                  have to worry myself none about it.

%qdt:
 Cyndassa, the serving maid of Queen Aubk-i
 of Daggerfall has sent me to slay a werewolf
 holed up in ___mondung_,
 for some reason. She can only pay me in
 information, and has promised to reveal
 what she knows of the Emperor's letter.
 I have =2mondung_ days to do this deed.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                    The body of the werewolf begins
<ce>                     to transform before your very
<ce>                    eyes. In just a few minutes, it
<ce>                    has become a young man who seems
<ce>                    to bear a strong resemblence to
<ce>                               Cyndassa.
