QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 Ah, %pcn, the %pct, good to see you!
<ce>                  I have something for you. I wish I
<ce>               could go myself, but my arm is still numb
<ce>                 from my fight with that ice Atronach
<ce>               years ago. But I am getting sidetracked.
<ce>                I have a once in a lifetime opportunity
<ce>                     for you, young %ra! Dragons!
<ce>                Well, small dragons really, but still!
<ce>                 Obviously quite a bunch of them have
<ce>                   hatched in some forsaken dungeon.
<ce>             They have already amassed quite a bit of loot
<ce>                         I heard. Interested?
                                     <--->
<ce>               Dragons have become very rare in Tamriel,
<ce>             %pcf, but every now and then some eggs hatch,
<ce>            and then we have a problem. Just recently some
<ce>            fledgling dragons have been harassing the area
<ce>                          around ___mondung_.
<ce>             Would you be able to go there and slay them?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    No? Really? Ok, Dragonlings are
<ce>              a bit dangerous, but for someone like you?
<ce>            Well, they don't make them like they used to...
                                     <--->
<ce>               I really thought you would love this one.
<ce>              Damn, I hate the thought that some knightly
<ce>                 order will be getting all the glory.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                           I knew you would.
<ce>                There are five of these baby-dragons in
<ce>                 ___mondung_ guarding their treasure.
<ce>               My guess is the knights will be after it
<ce>            like flies after dung when they hear about it.
<ce>                  So get to ___mondung_ and kill the
<ce>                   dragons within =1stparton_ days.
<ce>           Or they will probably have found them before you.
<ce>                 Good luck. I want to hear your story
<ce>                          when you come back.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 Sharpen yer sword, buckle yer shield
<ce>                    and off you go, as in the best
<ce>                            of fairy tales!
<ce>                    What are you still doing here?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              Incredible, wonderful! I was a bit worried
<ce>               I might have talked you into something a
<ce>                bit too dangerous. But finally you are
<ce>                    the fighter I thought you were.
                                     <--->
<ce>                          You are back, %pcf!
<ce>                  You have to tell me all about this!
<ce>                And did you find the Dragons treasure?
<ce>                      And did they breathe fire?

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
 Smoke rises out of ___mondung_
 nobody dares go near it.
<--->
 I saw a dragon the other day. Small and distant, 
 but I swear it was a dragon.
<--->
 They say a terrible fate has befallen a town 
 near ___mondung_, all the 
 banks and the mages guild were plundered.
<--->
 A whole flock of dragons is harassing %reg

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
 A hero of %kno has slain dragons in 
 ___mondung_. What a hero!.
<--->
 All hail Theostyr Buckingworth, the Dragonslayer of %reg! 

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The fighters guild beat the knights to slaying some dragons I heard!
<--->
Just imagine those dragons would have grown to full size!

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                     Hey! %pcn! Tell me the story
<ce>                      about those dragons again!

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   I feel bad about having sent you
<ce>                 after those dragons. That was way too
<ce>                    dangerous for someone like you.

Message:  1020
<ce>                That's five. According to _questgiver_
<ce>                 That SHOULD have been all of them...
<ce>                 But maybe some more eggs have hatched
<ce>                          in the meantime...

Message:  1030
%qdt: 
 The guildmaster of the Fighter Guild
 of ___questgiver_ has given me a
 hint about a nest of young dragons
 that have hatched in ___mondung_
 I need to find and kill them in =1stparton_ 
 days, otherwise %kno 
 might beat me to it.

Message:  1040
<ce>                   A terrible stench is in the air.
<ce>                        The walls are scorched
<ce>                      and feel hot to the touch.

Message:  1041
<ce>                       The beast howls in agony.
<ce>                     From not so far away you hear
<ce>                     answering rumbles, and claws
<ce>                          on the stone floor

Message:  1042
<ce>                  This must be the Dragons treasure!

Message:  1043
<ce>                          The Dragon is mine!
<ce>                         Only mine, you hear!
<ce>                           You cant have it!

Message:  1044
<ce>                   You are after my Dragon, villain?
<ce>                    Thou shalt not steal my glory!

QuestTimeLapse:  [1045]
<ce>                From far away you hear a man shouting:
<ce>               "Dragon, where are you? Draaaagoooonnn!"

Message:  1046
<ce>                            Hold it, knave!
<ce>                  No need to fight it out like this.
<ce>                I offer you 5000 gold if you leave the
<ce>                  Dragonlings to me. What do you say?

Message:  1047
<ce>                    I knew that would make sense to
<ce>                a ruffian like you. Here, take the gold
<ce>                              and leave!

Message:  1048
<ce>         In that case you will have to fight me to the death!
<ce>          I am not as easy an opponent as you seem to think.

Message:  1049
<ce>                     Somewhere in the far distance
<ce>                  you can make out sounds of fighting
<ce>                  soon followed by a cry of victory.
<ce>                seems one of the knights has found the
<ce>                             Dragonlings.

Message:  1050
<ce>                 The time to slay the Dragonlings and
<ce>                report to the Fightes guild has passed.
<ce>                  They will believe you have failed.

Message:  1080
<ce>                  Hey, since you've been such a hero,
<ce>                     here's a map to ___newdung_.
<ce>                    I have never been there myself,
<ce>                   but hey, I am sure there will be
<ce>                        some treasure to find.
