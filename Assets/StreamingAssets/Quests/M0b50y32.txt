<ce>                         Welcome again, %pcf.
<ce>           I just got an offer from someone with a dangerous
<ce>                occupation: _hunter_, a vampire hunter.
<ce>                  He says %g needs a hardy mercenary
<ce>                 who is not afraid of the creatures of
<ce>              the night to help %g2. And who values good
<ce>                  pay for his work. Do you think that
<ce>                   this description fits you, %pcn?

<ce>                              Hello %pcf!
<ce>                  Have you ever met a vampire hunter?
<ce>                   I just had one of them, _hunter_,
<ce>             here and I tell you, %g is nearly as scary as
<ce>                          a vampire %g2self!
<ce>        Anyway, %g has offered us a job, and %g will pay well!
<ce>        %g needs someone to accompany %g2 on %g3 next crusade.
<ce>               %g specifically asked for an experienced
<ce>           mercenary who does not know fear at day or night.
<ce>                  Do you think this is a job for you?
                                     <--->
<ce>            _hunter_ the vampire hunter dropped by earlier
<ce>       today, %g is looking for someone to help %g2 on his hunt.
<ce>      I am sure you think this is the perfect job for you, right?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>           All right, I am not sure I would mess with those
<ce>                         bloodsuckers myself.
                                     <--->
<ce>              _hunter_ is an experienced vampire hunter,
<ce>              you are missing out on a great opportunity!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                        I thought so too, %pcf
<ce>              _hunter_ is waiting for you at _townhouse_.
<ce>             Here in __townhouse_. Meet %g2 today between
<ce>             8 pm and midnight, %g will tell you the rest.
<ce>           Don't be late, I don't want %g2 to be mad at me!
<ce>          Oh, I almost forgot, %g will pay you _reward_ gold.
                                     <--->
<ce>            Good, just take good care of yourself, vampires
<ce>                       can be a dangerous bunch.
<ce>                _hunter_ will meet you in _townhouse_,
<ce>             that's one of the more popular Inns in town.
<ce>               We agreed on 1000 gold for your services,
<ce>             that really isn't that bad. Be there between
<ce>                   eight and midnight this evening!

<ce>                      How is the hunt going %pcf?
                                     <--->
<ce>                    I will talk to you later, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                And so the hunt ends. May Tamriel sleep
<ce>                          a little safer now.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
 _hunter_, the great vampire hunter of %reg is in __townhouse_.
<--->
 I wonder if _hunter_ will not do more harm than good,
 stirring up those vampires?
<--->
 _hunter_ is still one of the greatest hunters of vampires, but %g has been   
 paralyzed in one of %g3 hunts, and cannot wield a sword anymore.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
 There are voices about at night and moving shadows. Its not safe anymore in
 %reg.
<--->
 Vampires have taken my little cousin. His pale corpse was found in the
 graveyard in the morning, not a drop of blood in him...

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
 _hunter_ and some %ra have dealt a severe blow to the vampires of %reg.
<--->
 Thanks to this %pct of the fighters guild 
 we can all sleep in peace again!
<--->
 Hunters one, vampires zero, eh, %pcf?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
 Ah, the vampire hunter is back!

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
 The deathless ones have had their way, it seems.

 I have been hired by a vampire hunter.
 _questgiver_ of the fighters guild 
 in ___questgiver_ asked me
 to meet _hunter_ at _townhouse_ 
 this evening between eight and midnight.
 _hunter_ will than tell me what %g 
 expects me to do.

Message:  1021
%dat:
 I have met _hunter_, the vampire hunter.
 %g is quite an imposing figure, but %g is slightly
 paralyzed from a curse a mighty vampire put on %g2.
 Therefore I am to be %g3 sword and shield on 
 %g3 mission to destroy a dangerous vampire clan.
 We must first find _contact_, who has 
 contacts in the vampire world.
 Unfortunately _contact_ went into hiding, 
 probably because being threatened by the vampires. 
 But someone on the streets is bound to know something.
 In =findhint_ days we should have found him.

Message:  1022
 %dat:
 Today we have found _contact_ at %g3 
 hideout in __hideout1_.
 %g gave us the name of his contact, 
 a vampire named _goodvamp_,
 who is seeking a cure for 
 %g3 condition. %g can be 
 found in _vamphome_, 
 a house in __vamphome_.
 It should take no more than =findhint2_ days
 to find %g2.

Message:  1023
 %dat:
 _goodvamp_ has told us of %g3 "bloodfather"
 who hides in ___hideout2_.
 By killing this mighty
 vampire _goodvamp_s soul 
 would be freed from the curse
 of vampirism, and so would be those of
 all who belong to the bloodline,
 _hunter_ tells me.
 _goodvamp_ warned us of the 
 strength and power of the bloodfather
 and his minions.
 We must kill him in =findvamp_ days or 
 he will move to another place.

Message:  1040
<ce>              _hunter_, the vampire hunter has left town.
<ce>                 You will not be able to find %g2 now.

Message:  1041
<ce>              Greetings! You are from the fighters guild,
<ce>             I assume? Good, looks like _questgiver_ found
<ce>             someone who is suited for this kind of work.
<ce>                          So your name is...?
<ce>                  %pcn... well %pcf, we should get to
<ce>            know each other, since we are going to face the
<ce>                     powers of darkness together.
<ce>          What do you know about vampires, %pcf? Whatever you
<ce>          think you know, the truth is worse. There are many
<ce>          of them, far too many, and always they are becoming
<ce>            more. They suck the very strength out of %reg,
<ce>          plotting and scheming and killing... Struggling to
<ce>             gain power and to ultimately turn us all into
<ce>                    monstrosities like themselves.
<ce>            They must be stopped, %pcf, and that is my job
<ce>                        And now yours as well.

Message:  1042
<ce>          I plan to stamp out a dangerous group of vampires.
<ce>          I have already learned much about them, but now my
<ce>                 main contact, _contact_ has vanished.
<ce>       I don't know if the vampires are behind it, or something
<ce>            else happened - either way we need to find %g2.
<ce>           I am too well known, so I will keep myself in the
<ce>               background, while you ask around for %g2.
<ce>                  Someone is bound to know something.
<ce>            This should not take more than =findhint_ days.
<ce>              If we have not found %g2 then, I guess our
<ce>              cause is lost. So, whenever you are ready,
<ce>               lets go outside and start asking around.
<ce>               Try not to arouse too much suspicion, ok?

Message:  1043
<ce>                          %oth, its _hunter_!
<ce>                How in Oblivions name did you find me?
<ce>               And who are you, %ra? Well, welcome %pcn,
<ce>                     you have a dangerous friend!
<ce>                     I wish you had not come here
<ce>               _hunter_, your interest in me has already
<ce>                      exposed me to great danger.

Message:  1044
<ce>                            _hunter_ says:
<ce>                   %oth! You have promised to reveal
<ce>                   a contact, and now I have to hunt
<ce>                       you through all of %reg!

QuestTimeLapse:  [1045]
<ce>                            _contact_ says:
<ce>                          Yes, I did promise!
<ce>                 I told _goodvamp_ about the cure you
<ce>                   mentioned, and %g was interested.
<ce>                      But you have been careless!
<ce>              After your last visit I had another one...
<ce>                 A Vampire was floating in front of my
<ce>                    window the very night you left.
<ce>                It started to cast what I think was an
<ce>             "open" spell, so I ran to the temple as fast
<ce>                as I could, and since then I have spent
<ce>                  every night in a different temple.
<ce>                   You are being followed, _hunter_!

Message:  1046
<ce>                            _hunter_ says:
<ce>             That is bad news indeed. It was smart to flee
<ce>              to the temple. Still I think it would be in
<ce>                your best interest to give me the name
<ce>               and whereabouts of this vampire you know,
<ce>                    the one that wants to be cured.
<ce>                 If we can get to one of their elders,
<ce>                  it will greatly dimish their power,
<ce>                        and you would be safe.

Message:  1047
<ce>                  Very well. The name is _goodvamp_,
<ce>                  of __vamphome_. Be careful how you
<ce>                   approach %g2, %g is very touchy.
<ce>               The place where %g is hiding is known as
<ce>                              _vamphome_.
<ce>                 You better hurry, in =findhint_ days
<ce>                 %g has told me %g will leave to find
<ce>                          a cure by %g2self.
<ce>                  Now you know all you need to know.
<ce>                   I will leave soon, I guess if you
<ce>              managed find me here, so will the vampires.

Message:  1048
<ce>                 Behind you you here _hunter_ whisper:
<ce>            "I have a feeling, %pcf, we are being followed.
<ce>             I expect we might be attacked after sundown.
<ce>           Be prepared. I cant help you much with fighting."

Message:  1049
<ce>             There you are _hunter_, have you come for my
<ce>          life or my knowledge? _contact_ gave me information
<ce>          that I could be cured, become a normal human again,
<ce>          when the bloodline is broken and %g said you would
<ce>                        help me with this task.
<ce>            I have done as %g told me, and I have found the
<ce>                 name of the abode of my bloodfather.
<ce>           I hope you do not deceive me, or I would be both
<ce>                    a traitor and still in misery.
<ce>                You will find my elders in ___hideout2_
<ce>              But be warned, they are old and strong and
<ce>              wise in the use of Magicka. Also, they will
<ce>                      move on in =findvamp_ days.
<ce>           I hope you can find and kill them, and release me
<ce>            from this urge to taste the blood... even now,
<ce>                              even yours.

 I will curse you and your guild for not

<ce>               Well %pcf, we have not found _contact_ in
<ce>              time, I think there is no use in trying any
<ce>           longer. Its a bit disappointing, maybe next time
<ce>           I should hire someone with better tracking skills
<ce>                         instead of a fighter.

<ce>             Now let us escape from this hideous dungeon.

Message:  1080
 _hunter_ is a well known vampire hunter.
<--->
 Yes, %g is hunting vampires. You may find %g2 in _townhouse_.
 Or maybe %g's gone. That one is always on the move.

Message:  1081
 _contact_ has vanished, how odd. Well, %g has 
 always been a bit odd %g2self.
<--->
 Have YOU seen _contact_? I really need to talk to %g2.
<--->
 A lot of people are looking for 
 _contact_ these days.
 I heard %g fled to _hideout1_.
 Can't remember the name of the town though...
<--->
 Maybe I can help you, %pcf. Someone saw _contact_ 
 in a temple in __hideout1_
 a few nights ago. He has a friend there,
 who lives in _hideout1_.

Message:  1090
 _hideout1_ isn't that in __hideout1_?
<--->
 _hideout1_ that's not round here, is it?
 I believe it might be in __hideout1_?
<--->
 I knew a place with a similar name. They had the craziest parties there.

Message:  1091
 _vamphome_ that is where _goodvamp_ lives. %g is a very strange person.
