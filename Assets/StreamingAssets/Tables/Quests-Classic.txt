-- notes:
-   "reward bug" is a script error where reward is given before quest completed
-   "questor clear bug" is a script error where clicking on questor will cause quest to end immediately after target complete
-   "no hot-placement" is a DFU bug where resources cannot be placed to an active interior/dungeon. Need to exit and re-enter interior
-   "needs more action support" means DFU quest system needs more development for these quests to work properly.
