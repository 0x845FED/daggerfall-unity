-- These Fighter's Guild quests are considered "mostly working" under quest system in current state
-- Please use the Quest Hub forums for bug reports: http://forums.dfworkshop.net/viewforum.php?f=25

-- SCRIPT BUGS --
-- * Various script bugs are present - these are not bugs in Daggerfall Unity's quest engine.

-- "Reward Bug"
--  * Several quests allow player to click again on quest giver to immediately receive reward.

-- "Clear Bug"
--  * A similar issue is some quests fail to clear quest giver clicks at all prior to target completion.

-- "Spawn Rate"
--  * Some spawn rates are very low - e.g. M0B1XY01 & M0B20Y02 spawn every 30 minutes with 30% success rate.
--  * The target monsters do spawn, but player might need to rest 1 hour at a time to help trigger them faster


-- ENGINE BUGS --
-- * Discovered engine bugs will be noted below.
